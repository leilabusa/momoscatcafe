<h2>Momo</h2>
<p><img src="images/momo.jpg" alt="orange cat" width="300"><br>
Momo is the reason for the cafe opening. She is calm and gentle and loves to sit in your lap, especially if you are holding a warm drink. She is the perfect reading buddy and won't disturb you while you get work done.</p>

<h2>Prince</h2>
<img src="images/prince.jpg" alt="gray cat" width="300">
<p>Like his name suggests, Prince likes to be pampered. From being brushed to playing with his toys, any time he gets attention he is happy. (You might notice he likes to strut around the cafe like it's his.)</p>

<h2>Oreo</h2>
<img src="images/oreo.jpg" alt="tuxedo cat" width="300">
<p>Oreo is the most energetic and playful cat of the group. It's not unusual to see him dangling from the cat tree or pouncing on nothing. It's never boring when he's around! He loves to play with Lucy since she is always happy to keep up with him.</p>

<h2>Lucy</h2>
<img src="images/lucy.jpg" alt="orange cat" width="300">
<p>Lucy is a favorite for both regulars and newcomers. She warms up to people easily and may not leave your side for your entire visit if you decide to show her attention. She is great with children and always shows up when you feel sad and need a cuddle.</p>

<h2>Tiger</h2>
<img src="images/tiger.jpg" alt="white cat" width="300">
<p>Tiger is the guardian of the cafe. He likes to sit in high places and is easily startled, but after your first couple of visits he will run to you and purr to show his happiness with your return. He is protective of his favorite people and friends (especially Oreo, the youngest of the bunch).</p>

<h2>Consider Adoption!</h2>
One of the best parts about this cafe is it serves as a temporary home where these cats can be loved while they wait for a forever home. If you find yourself wishing you could just take your favorite cat home instead of leaving them,
consider <a href="contactus.html">contacting us</a> about adopting them!
