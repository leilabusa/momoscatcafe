<p>Hey! I'm Momo's owner. I thought I'd make this page to let you know a little bit about Momo and I, and how she came to be the mascot of our cafe.
	Momo is the first pet I've gotten in my adult life. She's been with me through every job and apartment I've moved to. I used to volunteer at my local pet shelter
	and that's where I met her. I had been working there for a couple of months and noticed she hadn't been adopted yet which was unusual for most cats that came in.
	I had always played with her and took care of her and I felt bad that she hadn't gotten a home yet. It confused me that the sweetest cat there kept being ignored.
	So, as soon as I was able to, I adopted her. Everyone who has met her agrees she is a sweetheart.</p>

<p>I had been thinking for a long time about how many cats out there were like Momo, except no one had come to adopt them yet. I wanted to do something to help them.
	One day the idea popped into my head. I had always wanted to open a cafe since I was little, and I realized I could put the two together and open a cat cafe. Since
	 there weren't many cat cafes around my area, I figured I could bring some joy to my community by opening a place where people could hang out. This
	 way patrons could enjoy themselves in a quite environment, and if they wanted to adopt one of the cafe cats, they could.
	Now that the cafe has been open for a few years, we have gotten many cats adopted, and we have loyal customers who like to stop by regularly. I'm so grateful everyday that I could achieve my dream with Momo and 
I couldn't have done it without customers like you, so thank you!</p>
