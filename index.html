<h2>Welcome to Our Cafe!</h2>
<p>Look through our menu and find the drink you're craving. We make our drinks with classic <strong>Arabica coffee</strong> brewed from the finest beans. If you don't like bitter
  coffee, we have sweet specialty coffees you can try, and even if you don't like either, you are still welcome to try our teas and pasteries. Enjoy your beverage or treat at one of our tables
or couches and be greeted by our cat friends!</p>

<h2>Come Say Hi to Our Cats</h2>
<p>We have so many feline friends who would love to meet you. From reserved to energetic, we have every type of cat personality for you to hang out with! All of our kitties (with the exception of Momo)
  are currently <strong>looking for homes</strong> so make sure to <a href="contactus.html">contact us</a> if you or someone you know are looking to add a new member to your family!
  To learn more about them check out the <a href="cats.html">cats</a> tab!
